### Build Status 
The project is currently in it's alpha from. Due to the time constraints. The project was 
planned to reach a minimal value product just to show case the potentail of final result. 
Naturally, there is yet a lot of polishinn to be done. However at this stage, all the basic functionalities
that would make the website operative and layout an infrastructure for furhter improvement is done.
Some functionalities are however partially complete.



### Technologies used 
The project is developed using MERN Stack Development framework. Due to the fairly larger 
scale of functionlaity for the project. We were in need of a developement framework that enables
us to develop moudles in the backend,frontend and the database, without having to face compatability 
hassle. We also opted to use typescript instead of javascript since it is more strongly typed which would 
yeild in a safer code and less time fixing type casting bugs. As for the version control client, Github was 
our choice as it is very widestream so there would be a very large support base. 


### Installation 
In order to install and run our system first install node.js 

#### Bash install
```
curl "https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/node-${VERSION:-$(wget 
-qO- https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/ | sed -nE 's|.*>node-(.*)\
.pkg</a>.*|\1|p')}.pkg" > "$HOME/Downloads/node-latest.pkg" && 
sudo installer -store -pkg "$HOME/Downloads/node-latest.pkg" -target "/"
```
#### Clone the Repository 
```
git clone git@github.com:alafty/ACML-Project.git
```
#### Install dependencies 

```
npm install 
```

#### Run the system 
Inside the home dierctory for the project run 
```
npm run dev
```
This command runs the Server and the Front end concurrently. By default,
the server runs on port 8000 and the client runs on port 3000. You can change the 
ports freely by creating a local .env file.


To access the website go to 

```
htttps://localhost|${Local Network IP}:${Client Port Number} 
```
You can also communicate with the server without the front end 
on port 8000.For testing purpouses, our developement team used postmam 
to manage server calls. 

Finally, you just need to create and connect your database.
