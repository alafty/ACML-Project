## How to run server

- Get everything ready by running:

```bash
    npm install
```

- To get server up and running, do:

```bash
    npm run server
```

>Hint: This command runs nodemon. Nodemon has
>one use. When you save any file, your server
>is restarted to keep it updated with the
>latest changes.  
>To run your server one time only, run
>`npm run node`. This runs the server without nodemon.  

>Nice-To-Know: `npm run [whatever]` runs a
>script that's defined in the `package.json`
>file. `node` and `server` are simply shortcuts for scripts. Take a look at them there!
